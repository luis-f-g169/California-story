                    My parents immigrated from Mexico to California in search of better
                    opportunities. This site turns that idea into a visual trail: one
                    main path (California) with side paths branching into key
                    opportunities that shaped who I am.

                    Scroll down to follow the path. Each stop unfolds in chronological
                    order&mdash;from early chances my family took, to my current path as
                    a Computer Science major, and the futures I’m still walking toward.

                This one-page site is designed so the main trail feels like it never
                ends. As you scroll “north,” sub-trails branch out into specific
                opportunities that California has given me&mdash;visually connecting
                migration, globalization, storytelling, and my future in Computer Science.
